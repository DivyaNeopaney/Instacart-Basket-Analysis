# Project Summary
This repository presents a comprehensive exploratory analysis of Instacart’s sales data, aiming to uncover significant trends in customer purchasing behavior. 
Acting as an Instacart analyst, the objective is to extract practical insights to support data-driven marketing strategies. The analysis explores key questions posed by the sales and marketing teams such as busiest hour/week of the day, customer spending habits, and product popularity across departments. 
It also includes customer segmentation analysis, highlighting behavioral differences based on factors like brand loyalty, geographic location, age, income level, and family dynamics. 
These findings will enable Instacart to design more personalized marketing efforts, increase sales, and improve the effectiveness of promotions and advertisements.
# Key Questions
- What the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders?
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
- Do people tend to spend more money at certain times of the day, and could this influence which products should be advertised during those periods?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
# Folders
- 01 Project Management – Holds the project overview and supporting documents.
- 02 Data – Divided into two subfolders (note: data files are not uploaded to GitHub due to size constraints):
  • Original Data – Contains the raw datasets.
  • Prepared Data – Contains the cleaned and processed data used for analysis.
- 03 Scripts – Includes Python scripts used for the analysis, developed and run in Jupyter Notebooks.
  - Will be added separately for 4.10 due to memory issues.
- 04 Analysis – Features a Visualizations subfolder with all charts and graphics created for exploratory analysis and insight generation.
  - Will be added separately for 4.10 due to memory issues.
